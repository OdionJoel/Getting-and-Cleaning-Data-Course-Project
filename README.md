# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones - Tidy Data Set

This repository contains the R script and related files for the analysis of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset. The dataset was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Files

- `run_analysis.R`: This script performs the analysis and generates a tidy data set.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the variables, data, and any transformations performed during the analysis.
- `tidy_data.txt`: The tidy data set generated by the analysis.

## Running the Analysis

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Download the Samsung dataset and extract it into your working directory.
2. Place `run_analysis.R` in your working directory.
3. Run the script in R or RStudio.

The script will read the Samsung data, perform the necessary transformations, and generate a tidy data set saved as `tidy_data.txt`.

## Code Book

The `CodeBook.md` file provides details about the variables, the data, and any transformations performed during the analysis.

## Tidy Data Set

The resulting tidy data set, `tidy_data.txt`, is a tab-delimited text file containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Notes

- The script assumes that the Samsung data is present in the working directory.
- The `dplyr` library is required for the script to run successfully.
